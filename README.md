*Are you ready for pain? Are you ready for suffering? If the answer is yes, then you're ready for writing compiler on Rustâ„¢ from scratch*

## 

Why do people use tools like Yacc, Flex, ANTLR, etc.? Recursive descent parsing is often more convenient. For implementing a toy language, you would likely use a parser combinator library or handwritten tools. In practice, this is often the case. Unfortunately, in universities, there are people who think differently.
